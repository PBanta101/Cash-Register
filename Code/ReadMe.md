Cash Register
===

The Cash Register program is an exercise in developing well-written, clean, thorough code using some fundamental programming structures and techniques to solve a well-understood application:
+ Prompt the user for a **Purchase Amount** and a **Payment Amount**
+ Compute **How Much Change Is Due**
+ Compute **How Many Of Each Denomination** should be given

The solutions given here are an iterative exploration of how the application can be written in different ways, starting with Sequence only, and then using more and more fundamental programming structures and techniques:
+ Sequence and Math
+ Methods
+ Conditionals (`if` statements)
+ Loops
+ Error Checking (`try` / `catch` / `finally`).
